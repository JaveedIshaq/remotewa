# Remotebase Hackfest
## Challenge from Remotebase

Build an app that solves the problem Of loneliness in remote work. In an
office environment, there are a lot of chance encounters, and people get to
interact a lot as they work out of the same place. However, this is hard in
remote work as people are not working out of the same location. Create an
app that solves this that enables teams to casually engage with each
other and interact with each other remotely. This can be through casual
video streams, online games, or any other idea that you come up With. This
challenge is completely open to however you want to solve this problem.
